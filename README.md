# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The Project Summary
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

Outcome
This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)
